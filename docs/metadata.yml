  \ Discover how Kotlin's expressive `if`, `when`, and loops revolutionize your code,\
  \ leading to cleaner, more functional solutions. Many languages make you assign\
  \ values imperatively, but Kotlin treats control flow as expressions, drastically\
  \ simplifying common patterns.\n\U0001F525 This is just 1% of the tips. Master the\
  \ full interview patterns in my book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G8H4QX2L/\nStop\
  \ struggling with complex coding challenges and system design hurdles. My book provides\
  \ the battle-tested strategies and deep dive into Kotlin, data structures, algorithms,\
  \ and system design that interviewers look for. Land that dream job, secure your\
  \ promotion, and become an indispensable senior engineer faster than ever before.\
  \ Elevate your career and ace every technical interview with confidence!"
